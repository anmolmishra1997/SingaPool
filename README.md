Car Pool Web App on PHP and PostGreSQL for CS2102

The system allows commuters to search or advertise car rides. A car ride is an
offer to ride in a car with the driver offering the ride from an origin to a destination on a date and a
given time. Both users and cars have a profile. Drivers advertise rides and passengers bid for the
rides. Users can play both roles of drivers and passengers. The driver or the system (your choice)
chooses the successful bid. Each user has an account. Administrators can create, modify and delete
all entries.
